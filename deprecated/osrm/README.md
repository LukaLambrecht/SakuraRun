# Distance matrix and routing using OSRM

Earlier attempt for constructing distance matrix and routing, using the OSRM API.
See here: https://project-osrm.org/
and here: https://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.24.0/api/#

Advantages: works out of the box, no registration or signup required.
But: only works for car profiles, bycicle and foot are not supported.

New approach will probably use GraphHopper, which does require an account,
but seems to allow more flexibility.
